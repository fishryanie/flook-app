Due to the increasing demand for studying as well as finding jobs online
So the FAA was born.
FAA solves the problem of bookcase space, home income, self-marketing, learning and entertainment
FAA is an application about reading manga, and reading books, in addition to the user can read by themselves, can use the audio function to listen to books, and some rights to earn income.
App can collect money and can pay users
There will be 2 types of users that are Voicers, and Authors who can make money from the app
To become a voiceover, the user must register an account, then through the voice test available on the app, the admin will change the permissions of that account to a voiceover. After reaching the corresponding KPI, you will receive Coins on the app. These coins can be used for transactions on the app or can be exchanged for phone cards.
As for the author, after passing the test, he can sell books, write books, and receive gifts from fans, the author can collect money from selling books as well as exchange gifts from fans into Xu,
Finally, about the collection of money from the app, the app will collect money based on the number of users who upgrade to a premium account to be able to view copyrighted books, author's book sales commission, and the amount of gifts fans buy for gifts. for the author
